**week 05**


This week we presented our rough outcomes for Brief 2! I really loved seeing how different each of the virtual worlds made the text feel. Before this viewing, I thought that the groups who had more choices in customisation of sets/characters etc. would have the best outcomes but it didn't really turn out that way. It only really came down to how well the group adapted to the world and worked with what they had already.

We then discussed Brief 3 and the selection of texts we could chose to focus on.
