**last week before semester break (week 6)**


For this week, we focused on github and creating paper prototypes. We were also taught about presenting large chunks of text in our code and different ways of utilising the movement and scale functions.

In small groups, we were told to re-create classic video games on paper. My group and I chose *Parking Panic*, and actually found it quite straight forward as the game uses a simple grid and doesn't have too many different variables. I think paper prototyping is very practical and useful. I'll make sure to make some for my future designs so that I can quickly see if I can execute the ideas that I have in my head well enough.

I loved this appearing/disappearing effect that Karen taught us. I definitely would like to incorporate this into my re-reading as I think it would suit the text and the text message 'feel' that I want to create.
