**last week before semester break (week 6)**


For this week, we focused on github and creating paper prototypes. We were also taught about presenting large chunks of text in our code and different ways of utilising the movement and scale functions.

In small groups, we were told to re-create classic video games on paper. My group and I chose *Parking Panic*, and actually found it quite straight forward as the game uses a simple grid and doesn't have too many different variables. I think paper prototyping is very practical and useful. I'll make sure to make some for my future designs so that I can quickly see if I can execute the ideas that I have in my head well enough. 

We were then taught about *pseudo-code* and tried writing some up for our daily actions. I wrote one about waking up; 

  **START** 
  *WHILE 930am THEN alarm goes off* 
  *IF alarm goes off THEN wake up* 
  *ELSE IF no alarm THEN continue sleep* 
  *ELSE IF snooze alarm THEN continue sleep*
  *ELSE IF cat annoys THEN walk to laundry and pour cat food* 
  **END**

I loved this appearing/disappearing effect that Karen taught us. I definitely would like to incorporate this into my re-reading as I think it would suit the text and the text message 'feel' that I want to create.
