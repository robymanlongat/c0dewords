**codewords = code + words, week 04**


For this week, we were taught how to incorporate text into our codes, manipulate it's position, alignment and change the typeface being used. We also explored applying movement and interactivity with the use of the mouse.

I really loved the look of moving text, especially in a circular motion. I was suprised with how smooth the end result turned out and got excited to learn about more of the things we could achieve through code.
