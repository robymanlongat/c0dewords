## Code

![](week4_type.jpg)

For this week, we were taught how to incorporate text into our codes, manipulate it's size, position, alignment and change the typeface being used. We also explored applying movement and interactivity with the use of the mouse. I think the interactive nature helps make the viewer a lot more engaged and excited with what is being presented in front of them. If I were to publish a large chunk of text, incorporating this would help ensure that the viewer would have a better experience.

I really loved the look of moving text, especially in this circular motion. I was suprised with how smooth the end result turned out and got excited to learn about more of the things we could achieve through code. I didn't realise there were so many possibilites and variables we could include. [Here's](https://robymanlongat.github.io/c0dewords/week04/week4type2remix) my remix of this amazing graphic. 

I'm excited to learn about more of the possiblities of coding. Hopefully I'll be able to incorporate these skills into my work in the future, it's definitely something that I don't see a lot of designers working with (not that I know of at least).
