# welcome to code+words! :) 

## Introductions

Firstly, we were introduced to our course and all the things we would be focusing on this coming semester. We were then put into groups to talk about the books we'd all read recently. I spoke about *"Who Moved My Cheese?* by Spencer Johnson. 

## Virtual Worlds

We all then met in *Minecraft*, where a virtual Flinders St was created (I never played Mincraft before and didn't realise just how much you could create/build). While walking around and dismantling the roads, our class discussed how important virtual spaces like these have become in the technology age, especially in the time of COVID. We also discussed all of the possibilites in these worlds, specifically with retelling stories.

## Code

Next, we were introduced to coding and the program to do it on, *Processing*. I was able to produce my [initials](https://robymanlongat.github.io/c0dewords/week01/initialsInteractive) and also add some interactive elements to it! I found it quite difficult to understand everything at first, especially getting used to the y-axis decreasing from the bottom, instead of increasing which is what I'm so used to.  

I'm so excited for what's to come of this course. I've never looked into code and I have a feeling it will be super different and exciting.
