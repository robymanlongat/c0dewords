# welcome to code+words! :) 

## Introductions

Firstly, we were introduced to our course and all the things we would be focusing on this coming semester. We were then put into groups to talk about the books we'd all read recently. I spoke about the book my mum forced me to read over the break, *"Who Moved My Cheese?"* by Spencer Johnson (pretty insightful actually). 

## Virtual Worlds

We all then met in *Minecraft*, where a very realistic virtual Flinders St was created. I'd never played Mincraft before and didn't realise just how much you could create/build! While walking around and dismantling the roads, our class discussed how important virtual spaces like these have become in the technology age, especially in the time of COVID. We also discussed all of the possibilites in these worlds, specifically with things like retelling stories.

## Code

We then moved on to what I was looking forward to the most. We were introduced to coding and the program to do it on, *Processing*. I was able to produce my [initials](https://robymanlongat.github.io/c0dewords/week01/initialsInteractive) and also add some interactive elements to it! 

I found it quite difficult to understand everything at first, especially getting used to the y-axis decreasing from the bottom, instead of increasing which is what I'm so used to. But overall, it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. Before this, code to me insisted of complicated problems and long math equations that were only able to be cracked by people who had been coding their whole lives. Starting slowly with the basics and taking it step by step made the process quite easy to follow.

I'm so excited for what's to come of this course! I've never looked into code before, I hope I'm able to keep up with it all.
