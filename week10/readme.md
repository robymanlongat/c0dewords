# Week 10! 

We began class with

## Major Project/ Code

We then got allocated one minute each to present the codes for our readings. 

I've combined the codes for paragraphs 1,2 and 3 together! [This](https://robymanlongat.github.io/c0dewords/week10/majorProject_all) is what I showed Andy, Karen and the rest of my classmates. I was a little shy to show such a simple code alongside such cool conceptual work that others had created, but I was surprisingly commended for my approach to start off with super simple graphics and really focus on the details. I think this also allowed me to really own all of my code and truly understand how everything works! 

I've also created some code for other lines of the text. I'm a bit stuck with trying to come up with ideas for other lines, especially line 4.
