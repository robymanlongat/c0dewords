# Week09!

## Major Project/Code

Class started with Karen sharing a voice/word/speech tracking code with us. Super cool and scary at the same time as it lead us down the track of censoring and (lack of) security. 

We then got into groups, depending on what we needed help with for our Major Projects. I confessed that I was worried to even start because I didn't know what to start with, but we encouraged each other and guided each other with the first steps. I found that as soon as I started with what I knew, I felt more comfortable than jumping into while focusing on what I didn't know how to do.
