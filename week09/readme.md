# Week09!

## Major Project/Code

Class started with Karen sharing a voice/word/speech tracking code with us. Super cool and scary at the same time as it lead us down the track of censoring and (lack of) security. She showed us how she programmed the code to be triggered to display something different whenever "code" was picked up by the mic. It would be amazing if I could include sound into my re-reading but I think I need to get my visuals down first before I can explore further. 

We then got into groups, depending on what we needed help with for our Major Projects. I confessed that I was worried to even start because I didn't know what to start with, but we encouraged each other and guided each other with the first steps. As soon as I started with what I knew (which was more than I thought), I felt so much more comfortable and relieved. So much better than jumping into it and only focusing on what I didn't know.

As I was typing the text into my code, I realised that it would be too much and take lots more time if I included all of it (which was my intial idea). I decided to leave out a couple of lines so that it wouldn't be too much text to work with.

The [first code](https://robymanlongat.github.io/c0dewords/week09/majorProject) I wrote up was just me deciding on the basics such as text size, colours and fonts. 

As I was having trouble figuring out how to add multiple events under the *mousePressed* function, I decided to just work on each of them on seperate Processing files. Hopefully soon I'll figure out how to do this.
