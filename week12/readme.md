# Celebration!!

## Major Project

My major project is finally done!!! Click [here](https://robymanlongat.github.io/c0dewords/week12/majorProject_finalefinale) to view! I fixed my minor problems which I mentioned on last week's entry with Karen's help. I also decided to automatically bring the reader to the error message, once the loading bar becomes full for paragraph 9 (previously the reader had to *mousePress*). Plus, I added an instruction to "click to start", in the beginning. 

The only problem I couldn't work out was the audio looping. All the commands I tried to apply to stop the looping affected the other components of the scene, (when it did work, the *mousePress* wouldn't take me to the next scene) so I decided to just keep it as it is. I think the effect the looping gives to the audio somehow works with the virus scene anyway! 

## Final Reflection
