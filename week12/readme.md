## Major Project

My major project is finally done!!! Click [here](https://robymanlongat.github.io/c0dewords/majorProject) to view! I fixed my minor problems which I mentioned on last week's entry with Karen's help. I also decided to automatically bring the reader to the error message, once the loading bar becomes full for paragraph 9 (previously the reader had to *mousePress*). Plus, I added an instruction to "click to start", in the beginning. 

The only problem I couldn't work out was the audio looping. All the commands I tried to apply to stop the looping affected the other components of the scene, (when it did work, the *mousePress* wouldn't take me to the next scene) so I decided to just keep it as it is. I think the effect the looping gives to the audio somehow works with the virus scene anyway! 

## Final Reflection

CODE

I chose this studio as I was very interested to see how I could incorporate code into my work as a designer. The way that Andy and Karen explained code through design made me realise how beneficial it would be for me to have even a basic understanding about code and the ways our devices generate images and text for a viewer. I think that knowing how everything works behind the scenes gives the designer a lot more control over all of the details of their work. 

I have to say that I was quite overwhelmed at times but whenever I could feel that it was just about to get too much for me, I would just step back and slowly take the code in, bit by bit. By making sure that I understood everything that I wrote, it was easier for me to make changes and find out what I needed to change when any problems would pop up. 

I underestimated the number of possibilities I had with coding. I feel like I could have come up with any concept and there would be a way to execute it through code. 

Overall, I’m so glad that I was able to learn a new skill while still being able to utilise my design skills that I already had before. I think everyone’s personal styles were able to be presented through their code which I think was really nice. I’m definitely interested in practicing more coding and learning about all the different directions that I could go with it. 

WORDS

I think now, I’m more aware of the way in which I take in the words or the stories that I read. Also that how they are presented affects me as a reader and how I feel after reading it. Considering this as a graphic designer is super important and effective when wanting to obtain certain emotions or moods from your target audience. 

It’s clear to me that every choice that I make during development will affect how the viewer receives my designs. I should always take the time to think about how everything works together and if they all serve a purpose.

I really enjoyed this semester and became so inspired by all the coders and writers that we were introduced to! I was even more inspired by all of the work that the rest of the class created. <3<3
