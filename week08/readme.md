# codewords week08

This week, we began the day by sharing with each other our paper-prototypes and thinking about the possiblities that we could incorporate as we move onto the next steps of creating our codes. Andy and Karen made me think about how specific and particular I can/*should* be to the typography and the timing in my final presentation as my initial idea is quite minimal. I should also consider including interactivity for a possibly more enganged audience.

We learnt so much this lesson about some different ways text and just individual letters can be presented through code. I found that using the functions *keyPressed* and *mousePressed* made the experience a lot more fun and remarkable. It would be nice to be able to include this into my re-reading; maybe the reader will have to type in "OK" for the next sentence to appear.
