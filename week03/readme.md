## Virtual Identities

![](chatbot.jpg)

This week, we looked at avatars and virtual identities. We were also introduced to electronic literature and the different ways that have been explored to tell stories such as the creation of Chatbots, Generative Texts and the Animation of Texts. I honestly found this quite intimidating and scary as identities of actual people have been recreated and it could easily be turned around and used for the wrong reasons. 

## Interactive Text

We were asked to look online for as many interesting examples of these as we could. I found an [interactive text](https://webyarns.com/howto/howto.html) that retold the classic, *Bonnie and Clyde* more suitable for this "digital age". While clicking through this story, I was very interested to see what the artist had come up with for whatever was coming up next. He incorporated everyday actions that we make on our phones such as searching for instructions on Google, creating a casual vibe for such an intense story. I would like to try and recreate this casual vibe for my re-reading for Brief 3.
