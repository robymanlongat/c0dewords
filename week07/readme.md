**back from sem break!**

This week, we started our class by revisiting the areas that we covered in the first semester. We then got into groups and shared our paper prototypers to each other, giving feedback and any suggestions that we had. I love when I get to see other people's work, especially when it's still in progess as I am able to learn  so much from them and the things that they think about during development.
