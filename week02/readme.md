# code + words week 2!

## Modular Typefaces

![](multipli.jpg)

This week, we discussed modular typeface designs. We gathered fonts and artists from the internet and presented our best finds to each other. I came across the female typographer, Fanette Mellier and her type *Multipli*, that was created referring to a poster folding principle. The letters appear from the folds and the back of the subtracted shapes make new colors arise. I found Mellier's decision to colour the back of the posters different from the front very clever.

After the class shared each of their fonts, we gathered that a lot of typographers, even up to now, start with the foundations of particular artists' works, especially Anh Sang Soo's. 


## Brief 2

We then decided that for Brief 2, my group, *Wholesome Animal Crossing/ Forever in Tom Nook's Debt Animal Crossing* would re-read Section 3.


## Code

After seeing some of my classmates experimental letters that they created through code, I wanted to see if I could come up with something different to what I did last week. I'm still trying to get used to the numbering system and even the values of the different colours. (now that I look at this, the diagonal stem doesn't appear to be strong enough, resulting in it to look more like a P rather than an R.)
