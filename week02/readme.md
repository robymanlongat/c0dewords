# code + words week 2!

## Modular Typefaces

![](multipli.jpg)

This week, we discussed modular typeface designs. We gathered fonts and artists from the internet and presented our best finds to each other. I came across the French typographer, Fanette Mellier and her type *Multipli*. Created by referring to a poster folding principle. The letters appear from the folds and the back of the subtracted shapes make new colors arise. I found Mellier's decisions with colour and a simple division of just one versitle shape very clever. 

After the class shared each of their fonts, we gathered that a lot of typographers, even up to now, start with the foundations of particular artists' works, especially Anh Sang Soo's. 

This made me think about just how many typographers would have started with simple grids and shapes to create their fonts. I think when there is a pattern or structure given to creating typefaces, it results in successful and refined outcomes.


## Brief 2

Everyone then decided on which virtual world they would like for Brief 2. I chose to join the *Wholesome Animal Crossing/ Forever in Tom Nook's Debt Animal Crossing* group because I thought that since it is such an innocent and cute game, performing the horror novel would result in something super great. I think that players of Animal Crossing are also able to customise and edit enough, to be able to capture specific moods and tell stories.

We chose to re-read section 3. I can't wait to see what we will be able to come up with for this project!

After seeing some of my classmates experimental letters that they created through code, I wanted to see if I could come up with something different to what I did last week. I'm still trying to get used to the numbering system and even the values of the different colours. (now that I look at this, the diagonal stem doesn't appear to be strong enough, resulting in it to look more like a P rather than an R.) I'll keep practicing :)!
