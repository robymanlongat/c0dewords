# Almost there!!

## Major Project Feedback

We dedicated this class to get some feedback from Karen and Andy. 

Andy gave some great suggestions regarding the overall experience of my presentation, which I think I'll be applying to my code before submission. The most significant change I'm thinking of making is introducing a reward system to be shown for every "OK". I think this will allow for the reader to be more engaged and more interested in seeing what the end of the reading looks like. We spoke about how it could be something to do with the "useless" likes that we receive on social media. This idea really supports my intention to point out the idea of us being in an internet era, always wanting more, in the shortest amount of time possible. Another suggestion that was given was to apply some sound for each time the "OK"'s appear. I'm thinking of also adding one on the 'winner' scene, to exaggerate it further.

## Homework

[Here's](https://robymanlongat.github.io/c0dewords/week11/majorProject_finale) my final copy for now. I decided on using facebook likes for the reward, adding on each time the reader agrees to a statement. I had them with the "OK's" at first but I choose for just the likes to appear as I think it's much more effective. 

I've also swapped paragraph 3 for a *frameCount* graphic to cut down on the amount of mouse clicks. Also, instead of a word appearing one at a time, I decided on just splitting the sentence into 4 segements as I think it flows a bit nicer. Although it seems to be starting as soon as the sketch is opened because when I get to para3's scene, it's already up to the last line. 

Some other fixes I need to make are:

1) the tada at the end sounds like there's multiple playing at a time
2) my lines that split the page into 4 for para16 appear for a bit then disappear
3) some shapes and text are distorted/shift postions when I open my code in a smaller browser (shown below)
